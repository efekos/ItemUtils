# ItemUtils

All this plugin does is adding some details to the items on ground.

With this plugin, every item on the ground gets a display name that shows their name and count. Rare items will spread sparks and all items will blink red right
before their despawn. Hologram items (items that never disappear and usually cant be picked up) won't get affected from this.


A quick example of all kind of items on the ground, some of them spreading different colors of sparks because of their rarity:
